# Titanic-Data-Dive
## Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description

This project involves analyzing and visualizing the Titanic passenger data. The key steps undertaken in this project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. The primary objective is to gain insights into the passenger demographics and survival rates.

## Files

- **Titanic.csv**: Contains the raw Titanic passenger data with various attributes such as passenger details, ticket information, and survival status.
- **Titanic_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved:
1. Handling missing values in columns like `age`, `cabin`, and `embarked`.
2. Converting data types for appropriate columns.
3. Standardizing categorical variables.
4. Removing duplicates and correcting erroneous data entries.

## Data Visualization

Several visualizations were created to explore and present the data:
1. **Survival Rate Analysis**: Comparison of survival rates based on different passenger classes, gender, and age groups.
2. **Passenger Demographics**: Analysis of the distribution of passengers based on age, gender, and class.
3. **Fare Analysis**: Examination of ticket fare distribution and its relation to survival.
4. **Embarkation Point Analysis**: Analysis of passenger embarkation points and their impact on survival.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the Titanic passenger data through systematic data cleaning and visualization. The insights derived from the analysis can be valuable for understanding the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic.
